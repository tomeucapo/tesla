Given the great need of energy saving due to the rising price of KW, and try to educate the consumer smart energy companies. 
We look for preventive monitoring systems electricity consumption, so that this can be a more correct action and make optimum 
use of electricity. 
So this project is focused on developing a system to acquire electric measurements, and so can make a cost estimate equivalent 
considering relevant rates to calculate their cost. In the market there are many proprietary solutions (not open) that involve 
a high cost additional licenses, which are often not tolerable for the company, so we aim to provide an open system which can 
integrate different solutions into a single hardware system for monitoring and analysis of both measures to be totally flexible 
to implement integrations with web services that use rise from websites, mobile applications in mobile and tablets. As well as 
being flexible also be integrated with other hardware solutions for the electric measurements, and thus provide a comprehensive 
and open solution.
